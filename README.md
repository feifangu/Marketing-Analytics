# Marketing-Analytics

This project aims to help Pernalonga, our client to develop a marketing campaign focusing on Shampoo and Hair Conditioner categories to experiment on personalized promotions. Specifically, our team will propose the brand to invite, the customers to target with and the specific products to promote. This marketing campaign aims to maximize the opportunity for incremental sales and profits for Pernalonga, thus we also include additional cost and benefit analysis in the end for reference.
